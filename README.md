Credit card fraud detection using machine learning is the process of applying advanced algorithms to identify suspicious or fraudulent transactions in real time. Since fraudulent activities are rare compared to legitimate ones, the problem is highly imbalanced, making traditional accuracy-based models ineffective. Machine learning approaches such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks are trained on historical transaction data, which may include features like transaction amount, time, location, and behavioral patterns of users. These models learn to recognize hidden patterns that distinguish fraud from normal spending
